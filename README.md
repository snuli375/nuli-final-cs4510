# writeup

my original idea was to make a game based using behavior trees or a utility based system to try to mimic a game like monster prom. however, i realized (of course after i had implemented the behavior tree), that monster prom uses a probabalistic approach that i honestly wasn't sure counted as ai. instead, i decided to use the behavior trees to make a combat-like??? system game. i was hoping to create a class for a challenger (so the challenger and the player would fight over one cat, and the cat would respond to both the challenger and player, and the challenger would respond to the player and cat), but unfortunately i didn't have time! instead i just implemented the cat.
